   - Emphasizes immutability, first-class functions, and declarative code.
2. **Concise Syntax**:  
   - Minimal boilerplate code with strong type inference.
3. **Interoperability**:  
   - Seamless integration with .NET libraries, C#, and VB.NET.
4. **Data-Oriented Programming**:  
   - Includes tuples, records, discriminated unions, and pattern matching.
5. **Asynchronous Workflows**:  
   - Built-in support for asynchronous programming.
6. **Type Providers**:  
   - Enables automatic generation of types for external data sources.
7. **Cross-Platform**:  
   - Fully compatible with .NET Core, .NET 5+, and .NET Framework.
8. **Scripting Support**:  
   - Ideal for rapid prototyping and scripting.
